# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are files that contain configuration information, functions, scripts, and other customization information that programs may execute when they start. You will notice that most of the files in this directory all end with **rc**.  It means "run commands", but you can just think of them as configuration files. 
 
This directory will include some generally useful dotfiles for the following things: 
- bash (and keyboard inputs for bash)
- gdb 
- vim 

## `.bashrc`

// todo: write this

## `.inputrc`

// todo

## `.vimrc`

// todo

## .gdbinit

// todo: cite the original git repo
